# Alien Invasion Game

## Overview
**Alien Invasion** is a classic arcade-style shooting game developed using Python and the PyGame library. Players control a spaceship and must defend Earth by shooting down waves of aliens. The game implements features such as player movement, shooting mechanics, alien spawning, and collision detection, offering an engaging, retro-style gaming experience.

## Features
- **Spaceship Control**: Move the spaceship left, right, and shoot bullets.
- **Alien Waves**: Aliens spawn in waves, advancing towards the player.
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Shoot down aliens using laser bullets.
- **Collision Detection**: Bullets collide with aliens, causing them to explode.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score based on the number of aliens destroyed.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when aliens reach the player's ship.
